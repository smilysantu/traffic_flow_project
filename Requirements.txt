Requirements
1. Video Dataset
- Input: Use the traffic video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNn9qKG2UFI
- Processing: Download and process the video within the script
2. Core Features
- Vehicle Detection: Implement a pre-trained COCO model (e.g., YOLO or SSD) to detect
vehicles in video frames
- Lane Definition and Counting: Define three distinct lanes and count vehicles in each
lane separately
- Vehicle Tracking: Use a tracking algorithm (e.g., SORT or DeepSORT) to track vehicles
across frames, preventing duplicate counts
- Real-time Processing: Optimize for smooth performance on standard hardware,
targeting real-time or near real-time execution
3. Output Requirements
- CSV File: Export with Vehicle ID, Lane number, Frame count, Timestamp
- Visual Output: Overlay video with lane boundaries and real-time vehicle counts per lane
- Summary: Display total vehicle count per lane at end of processing
